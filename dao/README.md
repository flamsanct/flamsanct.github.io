# Citadel DAO Overview

Citadel DAO is a fully on-chain [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) (DAO). The DAO owns and controls The Citadel game as well as all governance contracts. The spaceship NFT used to play the game is also required to participate in the DAO. Proposals submitted by ship holders are able to modify contract code as well as request funding from the treasury. 

To learn more about the thought process and theory behind our approach as well as a vision for the future of the DAO, read [Organizing The Citadel](/dao/org/). 

## Eligibility

In order to participate in governance you must have at least one Pilot Badge in your wallet. Pilot Badges are created by staking a ship NFT into the game and are burned by unstaking a ship from the game. You may [delegate the voting power](https://articles-orzd3tqhl-thecitadelgame.vercel.app/docs/delegating-votes) of a Pilot Badge to another pilot, and may also reclaim delegated voting power at any time.   

## Voting

The Citadel's on-chain governance system is built over OpenZeppelin's Governor, Timelock, and ERC20Votes bases. [Tally](tally.xyz) provides the front-end user interface and makes participating in governance simple and intuitive. 

Once a proposal has been submitted to the DAO, it can be voted on by holders of Pilot Badges. When voting, a user simply has to find the proposal they would like to vote on. Within the Tally UI, they can then click on the "vote" button. At this point, the user will be prompted to connect their wallet. When their wallet is connected, it is as simple as voting for, against, or abstaining.
