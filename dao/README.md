# Citadel DAO Overview

Citadel DAO is a fully player owned and controlled on-chain [(Decentralized Autonomous Organization)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/). The DAO owns and controls The Citadel game and launches alongside of it. Our governance token is the ship NFT, and holders are able to vote on the use of 70% of mint funds, 50% of OpenSea royalties, and all $ORE taxes collected. Proposals are submitted and voted on by players, and the DAO has full ownership and upgrade privileges to modify or update the governance and game contract code. 

With this document, our aim is to hammer down a sensible set of starting guidelines, processes, and best practices ahead of us all collectively stepping into the uncharted territory of launching a DAO owned on-chain game project together. 

To learn more about the thought process and theory behind our approach as well as the vision for the future of the DAO, read [Organizing the Citadel](/org/). 

## Eligibility

In order to participate in governance you must have at least one $BADGE token in your wallet. $BADGE tokens are created by staking a ship into the game and are burned by unstaking a ship from the game. You may [delegate the voting power](https://articles-orzd3tqhl-thecitadelgame.vercel.app/docs/delegating-votes) of a $BADGE token to another pilot, and may also reclaim delegated voting power at any time.   

## Voting

The Citadel will be controlled through a fully on-chain governance system, built over OpenZeppelin's Governor, Timelock, and ERC20Votes. [Tally](tally.xyz) provides the front-end user interface and makes participating in governance simple and intuitive.
