**Community Roadmap**

I thought it may be helpful to outline the rollout of development for the Discord, the DAO, the website, and overall onboarding efforts as we approach launch and the following month or two. Intended as a starting point based on what has already been discussed as well as some of my own suggestions. 

**Phase I: Pre-Launch** 
`Due:` ASAP
`Focus:` Discord optimizations + Educational materiel development
`Summary:`

One piece of feedback we have received is that some find it difficult to quickly get a broad strokes view of what the game is actually about. This will likely only be amplified as we enter the pre-launch sprint. To address this, we could work on a minor overhaul of the information channels including #read-this (possibly rename to #start-here) to become the first point of contact for newcomers. There, we can present a directory of helpful resources and simple explanations of the project, DAO, and game. 

The objective is to begin optimizing the on-boarding process for potential players of the game, who represent the first segment of the overall DAO onboarding process. Education on DAO participation basics will be provided at launch, but we will not initially overtly incentivize DAO *contribution* while we are still finding our footing post-launch (that will come later). 

I can take point on most of what's here if we agree it's the approach we want to take. 

`Action Items:` 

__Discord__
- Overhaul #read-this into first point of contact newcomer directory 
	- Concise synopsis of the project
	- Stance on the whitelist
	- Links to one or more expanded FAQs about the project, game, DAO
	- Community standards / rules (perhaps best written by @JimmyMayhem) + DAO Manifesto
