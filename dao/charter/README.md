## Purpose

Citadel DAO empowers a community of passionate players to have fun building and inhabiting an on-chain persistent world they own together. 



## Principles

- **Decentralization**: we stand for a decentralized, community governed metaverse.
- **Sustainability**: our decisions are guided by a long-term view of the game, community, and economy.   
- **Experimentation**: we reserve the freedom to try what's never been done before, take low-stakes risks, and iterate rapidly. 
- **Positive sum**: we prefer win-win outcomes and relationships.
- **Integrity**: we keep our word, we tell the truth, we do the right thing. 
- **People first**: we prioritize the well-being of the community above all competing interests.  
- **Transparency**: information about all aspects of the project is clear and accessible. 
- **Self-Motivated**: we are inspired to proactively find opportunities to share our gifts and talents. 

## Goals

More about the *types* of achievements rather than the achievements themselves (e.g. we see 5 working groups form vs. we build X or Y widget) 

What do we want the DAO itself to be prioritizing and working toward first? 

- Optimizing for balance between decentralization and centralization, incorporating the best of both at optimal levels
- Reaching operational self sufficiency independent of the Core Team
- Creating value for all stakeholders and a healthy livelihood for all core contributors
- Having fun as players, creators, and community members
- Building a cutting edge node of the decentralized metaverse
- Expanding the size of our network while strengthening the connections between each node
- Expanding the size of our community while strengthening the relationships between us
