# Citadel DAO Charter (Draft)

## Purpose

We are a decentralized game studio that builds worlds in the community owned metaverse. 

## Principles

- **Decentralization**: we stand for a decentralized, community governed metaverse. 
- **People first**: we prioritize the well-being of the community above all competing interests. 
- **Positive sum**: we prefer win-win outcomes and relationships.
- **Integrity**: we keep our word, we tell the truth, we do the right thing. 
- **Transparency**: information about all aspects of the project is clear and accessible. 

## Manifesto

This project started as the passion project of a long-time group of friends who wanted to contribute a better example of what a decentralized gaming project could be. The team is small, the budget is modest, but the vision is aspirational: we can do better in this space; we can expect more from founders; we can care more about our communities; we can demand higher quality web3 products; we don't have to resort to fake hype and trading integrity for follower counts.  

The future of the metaverse is too important to be defined by grifters, low-effort opportunists, and conquistadors from web2. We grew up playing games to escape the world, but increasingly it seems the world wants to become a game. Those of us here now may well decide what kind of game we all end up playing. We can continue on the path of zero sum total wars waged by those that aren't here for the right reasons, or we can choose a positive sum game we design for ourselves. 

We'll need to adopt a different mindset than the one that brought us here. We don't just need decentralized games, we need participatory game co-creation and co-ownership. When games are more than just games, absolute control by the few over worlds populated by the masses no longer makes sense. Power should vest in the players, and an infinity of worlds should be governed by the multitudes of those that inhabit them.

We know the stakes, and we know which side we stand for. We will build our citadel in the sky as a beacon for what we want the metaverse to be, and for whom we want it to serve.  We'll do it because it's fun, it matters, and nobody can tell us not to. 

## Goals

- Build The Citadel into a living, breathing on-chain persistent world alongside the Core Team.
