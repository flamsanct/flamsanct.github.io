# Citadel DAO Charter (Draft)

## Purpose

We are a decentralized game studio that builds worlds in the community owned metaverse. 

## Principles

- **Decentralization**: we stand for a decentralized, community governed metaverse. 
- **People first**: we prioritize the well-being of the community above all competing interests. 
- **Positive sum**: we prefer win-win outcomes and relationships.
- **Integrity**: we keep our word, we tell the truth, we do the right thing. 
- **Transparency**: information about all aspects of the project is clear and accessible. 

## Manifesto

From the beginning, The Citadel has endeavored to contribute  an example of what we believe a decentralized gaming project can be. Our ethos is encoded in the language of action: we can expect more from founders; we can care more about our communities; we don't have to resort to trading integrity for attention.  

The metaverse is inevitable. It is too important to be defined by scam artists, low-effort opportunists, and conquistadors of cringe from web2. We grew up playing games to escape the world, but increasingly it seems the world wants to become a game. Those of us here now may well decide what kind of game we all end up playing together: co-op or PvP? We can continue on the path of zero sum total wars waged by those that aren't here for the right reasons, or we can choose a positive sum game we design for ourselves. 

We'll need to adopt a different mindset than the one that brought us here. We don't just need decentralized games, we need participatory game co-creation and co-ownership. When games are more than just games, absolute control by the few over worlds populated by the masses no longer makes sense. Power should vest in the players, and an infinity of worlds should be governed by the multitudes of those that inhabit them.

We're building a citadel in the sky as a beacon for what we want the metaverse to be, and for whom we want it to serve.
